                       Trilinos CMake Transition Log
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this document is to track the progress made in the transition
of Trilinos to the CMake build system.

For each package, the following bits of information should be filled out:

     Package: The name of the package
    
     Package Transition Lead: This is the name of a person who has the primary
     responsibility to transition the package to the CMake build system and to
     certify that the transition is complete.
 
     Status: The status of the Trilinos transition effort for that package.
     Are the basic libraries at least there?  Are most of the tests and
     examples supported?  Are all of the important configure-time options
     supported?  Is the transition of the package complete?
 
     Final Certification Date:  When the package certification is complete

     Final Certification Evidence: What evidence can you provide that the
     package has all of the needed support in the CMake system?  If you are
     package lead you can determine this any way you would like.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Teuchos

Package Transition Lead: Roscoe A. Bartlett (rabartl@sandia.gov)

Status: Should be completely finished.

Final Certification Date: 07/16/2009

Final Certification Evidence: It is what it is.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: RTOp

Package Transition Lead: Roscoe A. Bartlett (rabartl@sandia.gov)

Status: All libraries, tests, examples and configure options are converted
over.  This is a pretty simple package so this is not hard.

Final Certification Date: 04/28/2009

Final Certification Evidence: I carefully looked over the test defined in
rtop/test/definition.  That file defines 19 tests.  I then manually matched
these up with the various CMakeLists.txt files where these tests are build and
the CTest tests defined from.  I ran the serial and MPI tests and I get 19
tests run from each.  I did not verify every single argument in every single
test output but I trust the CMake system after a lot of experience.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Kokkos

Package Transition Lead: Jim Willenbring (jmwille@sandia.gov)

Status: Completed, as far as what is in autotools is supported

Final Certification Date: 04/15/2009

Final Certification Evidence: All tests built under autotools have been cmakified
  and give the same answers. The Oski library support is not available though
  the experimental code and option is hooked up. The experimental tests do not
  compile due to the lack of the Oski library. There is no mention of this library
  in the autotools system as far as I can find. An autotools build for experimental
  had the same issues and no complaints about not finding the library when configuring
  - bmpersc

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Epetra

Package Transition Lead: Brent Perschbacher (bmpersc@sandia.gov)

functionality of the autotools system.

Final Certification Date: [???]

Final Certification Evidence: [???]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Shards (Non-released)

Package Transition Lead: Roger Pawlowski (rppawlo@sandia.gov)

Status: Has basic CMake support and some tests and examples.

Final Certification Date: 04/22/2009

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: GlobiPack (New Package)

Package Transition Lead: Roscoe A. Bartlett (rabartl@sandia.gov)

Status: New package supporting the CMake system only so is is finished.  It
has good unit tests so it is releasable right now.

Final Certification Date: 2009/02/11

Final Certification Evidence: See Trilinos/packages/globipack and nightly
tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Triutils

Package Transition Lead: Brent Perschbacher (bmpersc@sandia.gov)

Final Certification Evidence: All tests run and pass on autotools as well as CMake.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: EpetraExt

Package Transition Lead: Brent Perschbacher (bmpersc@sandia.gov)

Status: Code and all tests and examples listed in the definition file have been
  converted and run. Several tests that were only built are now being built under
  cmake. Not all of those builds could be sufficiently tested since the options 
  aren't all fully supported on my machine. Though they were simple enough that
  I'm fairly sure that the cmakification is right.

Final Certification Date: 3/23/2009

Final Certification Evidence: All tests are converted and match auto tools results.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Thyra

Package Transition Lead: Roscoe A. Bartlett (rabartl@sandia.gov)

Status: Should be completely finished except for a ModelEvaluator test.
However, this is being tested in down-stream packages so this is okay for
now..

Final Certification Date: 07/16/2009

Final Certification Evidence: It is what it is.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: OptiPack (New Package)

Package Transition Lead: Roscoe A. Bartlett (rabartl@sandia.gov)

Status: New package supporting the CMake system only so is is finished.  It
has good unit tests so it is releasable right now.

Final Certification Date: 2009/02/11

Final Certification Evidence: See Trilinos/packages/optipack and nightly tests

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Isorropia

Package Transition Lead: Cedric Chevalier (ccheval)

Status: All code and tests compile (without any warning) and pass.
Dependancies are correctly handle.

Final Certification Date: 2009/04/27

Final Certification Evidence: See Trilinos/packages/isorropia and nightly
tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Pliris

Package Transition Lead: Joseph D. Kotulski (jdkotul@sandia.gov)

Status:  Initial Cmakification done.  The tests exercise the 
double precision real libraries that are created using Epetra interfaces.

Final Certification Date: 2009/06/15

Final Certification Evidence:  All tests run and pass on autotools as well as CMake.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Claps (Non-released)

Package Transition Lead: None needed

Status: Will not be converted over to the CMake build system.  Claps will be
moved into Salinas and another solver package will be put into Trilinos in its
place.

Final Certification Date: [???]

Final Certification Evidence: [???]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: AztecOO

Package Transition Lead: Brent Perschbacher (bmpersc@sandia.gov)

Status: Completed.

Final Certification Date: 03/13/2009

Final Certification Evidence: All tests run under auto tools version are now being
  built and produce the same answer

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Galeri (Orphaned Package)

Package Transition Lead: Brent Perschbacher (bmpersc@sandia.gov)

Status: Completed

Final Certification Date: 4/14/2009

Final Certification Evidence: All tests running under autotools are now being run
  under cmake and produce the same answers. All tests being built under auto tools
  are being built under cmake as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Amesos (Orphaned Package)

Package Transition Lead: Jim Willenbring (jmwille@sandia.gov)

Status: Basic libraries and several tests and examples

Final Certification Date: 9/29/2009 

Final Certification Evidence: All CMakeified tests are passing.  We have
chosen not to CMakeify all 3pls for now.  If there is demand, we will consider
CMakeifying more in the future.  We would rather try to provide a little more
support for a smaller number of 3pls, than support more 3pls with the same
amount of resources.  3pls to support were chosen after surveying internal
and external users.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Ifpack

Package Transition Lead: Brent Perschbacher (bmpersc@sandia.gov)

Status: Basic libraries and several tests and examples

Final Certification Date: 2/24/2009

Final Certification Evidence: All tests and examples ran and worked on mac os X

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Komplex

Package Transition Lead: Brent Perschbacher (bmpersc@sandia.gov)

Status: Complete, in that all tests that the autotools actually builds are built
  and run. With the addition of one test so that there would be at least one test.

Final Certification Date: 4/15/2009

Final Certification Evidence: All tests and files built by autotools are built.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: ML

Package Transition Lead: Jonathan Hu (jhu@sandia.gov)

Status: Basic libraries.  All examples that run under the current test
harness.  Most of the tests that run under the current test harness.  The
tests that are missing are those that require CompareTestOutput, which
compares output to a "gold-copy" output file.  Ross has put this capability
in, but I haven't finished this off.

I've also added support for Zoltan as a TPL.  This was necessary until Alegra
(and maybe other Sandia apps?) switch to using Zoltan as a Trilinos package.

One big item that still needs to be done is fixing some nonstandard code that
breaks native Windows builds.

Final Certification Date: 4/29/2009

Final Certification Evidence: Almost all tests that were running under the old
test harness are in cdash and passing.  There are still some warnings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Belos

Package Transition Lead: Heidi Thornquist (hkthorn@sandia.gov)

Status: Builds and runs all tests with cmake/ctest.  This includes library support
    for all Epetra examples/tests and Tpetra examples/tests.

Final Certification Date:  4/28/2009

Final Certification Evidence: All tests and files built by autotools are built by cmake,
and possibly more.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Stratimikos

Package Transition Lead: Roscoe Bartlett (rabartl@sandia.gov)

Status: Should have complete support for all libraries, tests and examples.

Final Certification Date: 07/16/209

Final Certification Evidence: It is what it is.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Meros (Orphaned Package)

Package Transition Lead: Kevin Long (kevin.long@ttu.edu)

Status: Basic libraries and several tests and examples

Final Certification Date: [???]

Final Certification Evidence: [???]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: FEI

Package Transition Lead: Alan Williams (william@sandia.gov)

Status: Builds and run tests with cmake/ctest. It is possible that some
    minor changes still need to be made for optional dependencies and other
    subtleties, but I think FEI is pretty much cmake-ified.

Final Certification Date: 3/26/2009

Final Certification Evidence: more tests are being built/run with cmake than
with autotools.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: RBGen

Package Transition Lead: Heidi Thornquist (hkthorn@sandia.gov)

Status: Builds and runs all tests with cmake/ctest.  This includes library support
    for all Epetra examples/tests/drivers.

Final Certification Date: 4/28/2009

Final Certification Evidence: All files and drivers built by autotools are built by cmake.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Anasazi

Package Transition Lead: Heidi Thornquist (hkthorn@sandia.gov)

Status: Builds and runs all tests with cmake/ctest.  This includes library support
    for all Epetra examples/tests, Thyra examples/tests, and Tpetra
    examples/tests.

Final Certification Date: 4/28/2009

Final Certification Evidence: more tests are being built/run with cmake than with 
autotools

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: ThreadPool

Package Transition Lead: Carter Edwards (hcedwar@sandia.gov)

Status: Builds and runtest tests with cmake/ctest.

Final Certification Date: 7/16/2009

Final Certification Evidence: Tests pass.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Phalanx

Package Transition Lead: Roger Pawlowski (rppawlo@sandia.gov)

Status: Should have complete CMake support.

Final Certification Date: 04/22/2009

Final Certification Evidence: All tests are converted and match auto tools results.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Pamgen

Package Transition Lead: David Hensinger (dmhensi@sandia.gov)

Status: Thanks to the patient and very competent assistance of Brent Pershbaker
all tests have been moved over to ctest. The library and test executables 
are building with cmake. Additional functionality and support for the external
libraies Nemesis and Exodus have been added.

Final Certification Date: 05/08/2009

Final Certification Evidence: Tests converted to ctest and are identical to autotests

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Phdmesh

Package Transition Lead: Carter Edwards (hcedwar@sandia.gov)

Status: Initial cmakification complete. Libraries and a test have been converted.

Final Certification Date: [???]

Final Certification Evidence: [???]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: NOX (and therefore also LOCA)

Package Transition Lead: Roger Pawlowski (rppawlo@sandia.gov)

Status: NOX is complete.  LOCA is complete, except a configuration
test for GGEV which may not even be necessary anymore.

Final Certification Date: 04/22/2009

Final Certification Evidence: All tests are converted and match auto
tools results.  In fact we have better coverage under cmake since all
examples are now under nightly testing.  This is not the case for
autotools.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Moertel (Orphaned Package)

Package Transition Lead: Jim Willenbring (jmwille@sandia.gov)

Status: Basic libraries should be done.  This package never had any tests
(i.e. moertel/tests does not even exist and therefore moertel/tests/definition
does not even exist).  No other package in Trilinos depends on this package.
Since this package does not contain any tests it is questionable if this
package should even be released.  We found out that this package has users at
INL, so this package needs to be transitioned.  Though an ideal test suite
will not result, we probably should look at turning some of Moertel's examples
into tests.

Final Certification Date: 9/29/2009

Final Certification Evidence: This package should be in the same state as it
was with the autotools system.  The test suite should be improved, but that
task will have to be prioritized against other issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: TrilinosCouplings

Package Transition Lead: Jonathan Hu (jhu@sandia.gov)

Status: Basic libraries and examples are done.  Heidi got the epetraext
examples working.

Final Certification Date: 4/29/2009

Final Certification Evidence:  Local builds and cdash builds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Rythmos

Package Transition Lead: Todd Coffey (tscoffe@sandia.gov)

Status: Basic libraries and several tests and examples.  Almost complete.

Final Certification Date: [???]

Final Certification Evidence: [???]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: MOOCHO

Package Transition Lead: Roscoe Bartlett (rabartl@sandia.gov)

Status: All of the primary stable code (libraries and tests/examples) are
added.  I still need to add back support for MA28 but I can do that next.

Final Certification Date: 2009/04/17

Final Certification Evidence: I carefully went through the file
moocho/test/defintion and added every test that was there.  That file was kind
of a mess and was running a few exact same tests twise.  I also found out that
the perl test harness was not even running with all of the command-line
arguments and so was not even right.  I also added MPI(1) versions of every
serial-only test that I could to maximize the coverage for an MPI build.  I
have not performed coverage testing yet but I am very confident that I have
added all of the tests and more as was in the autotools/perl system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Aristos (Non-released)

Package Transition Lead: Denis Ridzal (dridzal@sandia.gov)

Status: Has not been started yet.  However, this package will not be released
in the upcomming release so it is not critical to get in CMake support.

Final Certification Date: [???]

Final Certification Evidence: [???]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Sundance

Package Transition Lead: Kevin Long (kevin.long@ttu.edu)

Status: All C++ libraries and tests converted. 

Final Certification Date: [24 Apr 2009]

Final Certification Evidence: [Tests are passing, with the exception of a checked STL problem and several random errors on Darwin. As these are unelated to cmake, I consider the cmake transition to be completed.]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: TriKota

Package Transition Lead: Andy Salinger (agsalin@sandia.gov)

Status: TriKota builds with CMake. TriKota has a dependence on 
Dakota TPLs. (There is still the issue of a circular dependency
between Dakota and Trilinos: Dakota depends on Teuchos, TriKota 
depends on Dakota. The snapshot of Teuchos in Dakota is updated
manually whenever they go out of synch enough to cause problems.)

Final Certification Date: 07-16-2009

Final Certification Evidence: The single test runs under ctest
and passes. The build and install is being tested nightly
as part of the Albany code project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: CTrilinos (Non-released)

Package Transition Lead: Nicole Lemaster (mnlemas@sandia.gov)

Status: Builds with CMake but no longer with autotools.

Final Certification Date: 07/16/2009

Final Certification Evidence: Has been consistently building for months with
cmake; the two failing unit tests are not related to issues with cmake.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: ForTrilinos (Non-released)

Package Transition Lead: Damian Rouson (rouson@sandia.gov)

Status: Has not been started yet.  However, since this is an experimental
package and is extremely small, getting CMake suppport is not critical.  Also,
this package requires *very* a recent GNU Fortran 2003 compiler and
compiler-specific issues like module file linking needs to be resolved.

Final Certification Date: [???]

Final Certification Evidence: [???]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: PyTrilinos

Package Transition Lead: Bill Spotz (wfspotz@sandia.gov)

Status: I consider the transition complete with the exception of TPL
support.  This is typically one-off: PyTrilinos supports Teuchos which
supports expat; PyTrilinos supports EpetraExt which supports HDF5;
etc.  Some or all of these may have been addressed since I last checked.

Final Certification Date: [???]

Final Certification Evidence: [???]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: WebTrilinos (Orphaned package)

Package Transition Lead: None needed (for now)

Status: Not started yet.  However, this packages does not represent a
significant capability and is only used for running demos and tutorials.  The
transition to the CMake build system can be put off until after the next
Trilinos release.

Final Certification Date: [???]

Final Certification Evidence: [???]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: Didasko

Package Transition Lead: Brent Perschbacher (bmpersc@sandia.gov)

Status: Complete with the exception of the epetraext examples. It requires a
  version of zoltan that is not the version that is in Trilinos. This will
  have to be researched more and probably envolves fixing things in epetraext.

Final Certification Date: 4/22/2009

Final Certification Evidence: All examples are producing the same results as auto
 tools builds (including the epetraext example which exits with a message about
 needing specific options to be enabled in both)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package: NewPackage

Package Transition Lead: None needed

Status: Do not represent a capability and therefore does not have to be
transitioned over to the CMake build system on any schedule.  When someone
want to update this it can be done but doing so or not doing so will not hold
up anything else.

Final Certification Date: [???]

Final Certification Evidence: [???]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
