error the way that an assert command does. */

/* The macro takes two arguments.  The first is the error code to be examined.  The second is an int that can be viewed either as an error count, or as a bool that simply indicates if any errors have occurred as of the time that the macro was run (zero -> no prior errors, non-zero -> prior errors). */
