  //! Teuchos::FILEstream: Combined C FILE and C++ stream

  /*! Teuchos::FILEstream is a class that defines an object that is
      simultaneously a C FILE object and a C++ stream object.  The
      utility of this class is in connecting existing C++ code that
      uses streams and C code that uses FILEs.  An important example
      of this situation is the python wrappers for Trilinos packages.
      Trilinos is of course written primarily in C++, but the python
      wrappers must interface to the python C API.  Wrappers for
      Trilinos methods or operators that expect a stream can be given
      a Teuchos::FILEstream, which then behaves as a FILE within the
      python C API.  This is a low-level object that should not be
      needed at the user level.
