    \brief Defines direct cubature (integration) rules in Intrepid.

    Cubature template (rule) consists of cubature points and cubature weights.
    Intrepid provides a small collection of frequently used cubature rule templates
    for FEM reconstructions on simplices (edge, tri, tet) and pyramid cells.

    For quad, hex, and triprism rules, see tensor-product rules
    defined in the class CubatureTensor, and its derived classes.

    Cubature rules for simplices and the pyramid are stored in the
    <var>cubature_data_</var> array.

    All templates are defined on a reference cell and can be mapped to physical space
    cells by the methods available in the MultiCell class.
