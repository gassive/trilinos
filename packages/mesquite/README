To build Mesquite, run the included configure script in this directory
and then run make.  For example:
% ./configure 
% make

For additional options, run:
% ./configure --help

Mesquite's build implementation does not yet have an "install" target,
so the configure options related to installation paths have no effect.

The "--enable-tstt" option must be specified to the configure script
to enable support for accessing mesh and geometry through the TSTT SIDL
interface.
