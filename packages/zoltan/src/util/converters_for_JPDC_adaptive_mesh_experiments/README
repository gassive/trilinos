Converters for running JPDC experiments on Johan Steensland adaptive mesh data.
Both programs assume 3D meshes.

exo2chaco:
     Reads a serial Exodus file and writes Chaco-formatted files.
     Built using the nem_slice tool, so there's lots of stuff in the
     source that isn't really needed.  Main changes are in elb_main.c
     and include method gen_chaco and code to write the chaco files.
     Executable segfaults, but the segfault happens after the Chaco
     files are written, so I don't care.  
     See file nem_slice_command for command line usage.
        gmake tbird
     produces Obj_tbird/nem_slice

chaco2chaco:
     Reads two chaco coordinates files and for each point in the second file,
     finds a nearby point in the first file.  Can actually operate on a 
     series of files, with each file being compared to the previous one.
     Command line:  
        chaco2chaco basefilename numberoffiles
     where each file must begin with basefilename and is called 
     basefilename.#.  numberoffiles is the largest file name.  There must
     be a file basefilename.0.
        cc -o chaco2chaco main.c hsfc_hilbert.c
     Example included:
        chaco2chaco junk3d 2
