    /*!
      \brief Arbitrary combination of status tests, implemented with safe memory management.

      In the \c AND (see NOX::StatusTest::Combo::ComboType) combination, the
      result is \c Unconverged (see NOX::StatusTest::StatusType) if \e any of
      the tests is \c Unconverged. Otherwise, the result is equal to the
      result of the \e first test in the list that is either \c Converged
      or \c Failed. It is not recommended to mix \c Converged and \c
      Failed tests in an \c AND combination.

      In the \c OR combination, the result is \c Unconverged if \e all of
      the tests are \c Unconverged. Otherwise, it is the result of the \e
      first test in the list that is either \c Converged or \c
      Failed. Therefore, it will generally make sense to put the \c Failed
      -type tests at the end of the \c OR list.

      \note We call checkStatus on \e every convergence test, though some
      may be called with the NOX::StatusTest::None option.

      \note This is identical in operation to StatusTest::Combo. but stores
      the constituent subtests using a reference-counted pointer. This ensures
      safe behavior if the constituent subtests go out of scope before the combo.
