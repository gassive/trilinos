            instantiation.

2. Kokkos - Fixed issue with building with latest CUDA and Thrust libraries

3. Tpetra - Fixed CUDA build errors with shared libraries and explicit 
            instantiation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release update 10.6.3 March 17, 2011

1. AztecOO - Bug: 5117. Fixed segfault when performing an AztecOO linear solve
             after having done a Nox non-linear solve.

2. Epetra - OpenMP improvements and threading of CrsGraph.

3. Epetra - Fixed issue with deleting static graph in CrsMatrix.

4. Epetra - Fixed bugs in CrsGraph methods InsertIndicesIntoSorted and 
            OptimizeStorage.

5. Zoltan - Fixed issue with gcc 4.5 over-optimizing.

6. Zoltan - Bug: 5051. Fix build issue with PGI compilers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release update 10.6.2 December 9, 2010

1. NOX - Fixed a compile error on VS8

2. Phalanx - Fixed graphviz output for boos versions greater than 1.43

3. Zoltan - Changed Autotools build to handle all TPLS identically

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release update 10.6.1 October 25, 2010

1. EpetraExt - Fix memory leak in PETSc interface.

2. EpetraExt - Added FECrsMatris extraction capability to
               PointToBlockDiagPermute.

3. Kokkos - Fixed some ansi/pednatic build warnings in the node tests.

4. Kokkos - Added sync() method to all nodes, modified node timings test to use
            it, documented it in Kokkos Node API module. Added cudaSyncThreads()
            to native CUDA/Thrust timings. Broke node timings into multiple
            exectuables, to keep TBB and TPI from stepping on each other.

5. Kokkos - Added native threading examples to Kokkos Node API tests for timing
            comparisons, kokkos/NodeAPI/test.

6. Kokkos - Added ifdefed TPI_Block() and TPI_Unblock() around GEMM calls in
            Kokkos::DefaultArithmetic<TPINode>

7. Kokkos - Added missing clearStatistics() method to CUDANodeMemoryModel

8. Teko - Fix build problem with GCC 4.5.1.

9. Tpetra - Added new HybridPlatform examples, under
            tpetra/examples/HybridPlatform. Anasazi and Belos examples are
            currently not built, though they are functional.

10. Tpetra - Added Added new MultiVector GEMM tests, to evaluate potential
            interference of TPI/TBB threads and a threaded BLAS, to
            tpetra/test/MultiVector.

11. Tpetra - Added Tpetra timers to Anasazi and Belos adaptors.

12. Tpetra - Added test/documentation build of Tpetra::CrsMatrix against
            KokkosExamples::DummySpasreKernelClass

13. Tpetra - Fixed some bugs, added some bug verification tests, disabled by
            default.


14. Zoltan - Fix bug in Distance-2 coloring code when all edges are external.
